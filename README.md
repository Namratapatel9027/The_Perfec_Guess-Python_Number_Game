## 🧠 Overview

**The Perfect Guess** is a simple number guessing game written in Python.  
The computer selects a random number, and the user has to guess it by receiving helpful feedback like:

- “Lower number please”
- “Higher number please”

Once the correct number is guessed, the game displays how many attempts the player took!

<summary>🎯 <strong>Key Features</strong></summary>

### 🔢 Random Number Generator
- Utilizes Python’s built-in `random` module to create a random number.

### 💬 Smart Hints
- If the guess is too high → "Lower number please"
- If the guess is too low → "Higher number please"

### 📊 Guess Counter
- Tracks the number of guesses it took the user to find the correct number.

### 🖥️ Terminal-based Gameplay
- Lightweight game with zero dependencies other than `random`.
- Great for practicing `loops`, `conditionals`, and `input/output`.
